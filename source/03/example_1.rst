Example 1: Sorachi River, August 2016
==================================================
From August 29th to 31st, 2016, heavy rainfall caused a levee breach and river flooding in the Sorachi River. Details on the heavy rainfall and flooding conditions are described in the investigation report [1]_, and the paper [2]_ (we apologize, but those references are in Japanese.).

This section demonstrates the procedure for simulating the flooding in the Sorachi River basin during that event using RRI on iRIC.

-----

２．Preparation of Rainfall dataset
--------------------------------------------------
The rainfall dataset is included in the "data_1/02_rain" folder of the data downloadable from "0. Sample Data". 
This folder contains processed rainfall data for the target area and period, extracted from analyzed rainfall data. 
For details on analyzed rainfall data, please refer to the `Japan Meteorological Agency website <https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/kurashi/kaiseki.html#:~:text=%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90%E9%9B%A8%E9%87%8F%E3%81%A8%E9%80%9F%E5%A0%B1%E7%89%88,%E3%81%94%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AB%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82>`_ をご確認ください。

The rainfall data for each time step, indicated in the filename, is stored in a separate file in ASC format. 
The time is in UTC. Data in ASC format can be visualized and displayed in GIS.
"asc2raindat.py" is a Python script that creates a rainfall data file in the RRI format from the ASC format data in the folder. 
If you have a Python execution environment, you can use it. 
If you do not have a Python execution environment, a file "rain.dat", which has already been converted to the RRI rainfall data format, is also included.

You can also prepare rainfall data using `UC tools <https://tools.i-ric.info/login/>`_, which is available to anyone upon registration. For the detailed procedure, please refer to "2. Preparation for a rainfall dataset" in the Overview.

3.2 Rainfall conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use the "rain.dat" data file shown in "2. Preparation of Rainfall dataset" for the rainfall conditions. 
"rain.dat" contains rainfall data for the Hokkaido region from August 29, 2016, 0:00 UTC to August 31, 2016, 23:30 UTC (71.5 hours) at 30-minute intervals. 
You can check the details of the data by opening the ASC files with a text editor.

Open the calculation condition setting screen from "Calculation Condition > Setting", select "Group > Rain", and set the following:

.. list-table:: Rain
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_1/cond_2_en.jpg
     - | Rain file: Specify the "rain.dat" file
     - | you downloaded as sample data.

     - | xllcorner_rain: 139
     - | yllcorner_rain: 41
     - | cellsize_rain_x: 0.0125
     - | cellsize_rain_y: 0.0083333
  
This completes the rainfall data settings.

3.5 Slope Simulation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slope simulation parameters are set in relation to the cell attribute "Land Use Type". 
In this example, since "Land Use Type" is not specified at all, "Land Use Type" for all cells will be "Region1". 
Here, we will not consider subsurface infiltration or groundwater flow, so set the following:

.. list-table:: Slope Simulation Parameters
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_1/cond_5_en.jpg

Summary
--------------------------------------------------
This section presented the workflow for using RRI on iRIC: preparing terrain and rainfall data, setting them as calculation conditions, running the calculation, and visualizing and confirming the calculation results.

Comparison of the obtained calculation results with the actual event is not performed here. We encourage you to try this yourself. We hope that you will deepen your understanding of the phenomena by adjusting parameters and recalculating as necessary.
