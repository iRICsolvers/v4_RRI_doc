Example 2：(RSR model) Kurokawa river, July 2017
==================================================
From July 5, 2017, heavy rainfall (the July 2017 Northern Kyushu Heavy Rain) caused numerous flood inundation with a large amount of sediment and driftwood in Asakura City, Fukuoka Prefecture, resulting in significant damage. 
This example demonstrates the procedure for applying the RSR model to the Terauchi Dam basin, located in the upper reaches of the Sada River, a tributary of the Chikugo River system, referencing the analysis results in [1]_.  (we apologize that the reference is in Japanese at this moment.).
This example alanlyze a sub-basin of the Sada River, the Kurokawa River basin (catchment area approximately 12.8 km²).

0. Sample data
--------------------------------------------------
The sample data used in this example can be downloaded from the following links:

- Terrain, rainfall, and sediment dataset → `data_2 <https://i-ric.org/uc/uc_products/rri_examples/Terauchi_data.zip>`_
- iRIC software project file →  `data_2_iRIC <https://i-ric.org/uc/uc_products/rri_examples/2017_kurokawa.ipro>`_

１．Creating the Watershed Topographic Dataset
--------------------------------------------------
This analysis involves landslide and debris flow calculations, requiring the creation of a watershed topographic dataset using a fine mesh size, such as 10m. 
The watershed topographic dataset consists of elevation data (DEM), the number of accumulated upslope cells (ACC), and the flow direction (DIR), and the creation method is described in Chapter 3 of the RRI manual and elsewhere. 
The watershed topographic dataset for this example is included in the data downloadable from "0. Sample Data," and the creation method is as follows:

- [1] Within Japan, 10m mesh elevation data (DEM) can be downloaded from the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan's Fundamental Geospatial Data (Digital Elevation Model). You can also obtain high-resolution terrain data from `ASTER GDEM <https://www.jspacesystems.or.jp/ersdac/GDEM/E/1.html>`_
- [2] Using hydrological analysis tools such as Arc Hydro tools, perform filling (Fill DEM) on the DEM elevation data, then extract the watershed and create the number of accumulated upslope cells (ACC) and flow direction (DIR).
- [3] Store the created data (DEM, ACC, DIR) in a suitable location.
-----

２．Creating the Rainfall Dataset
--------------------------------------------------
The rainfall dataset is included in the "data_3/02_rain" folder of the data downloadable from "0. Sample Data". This folder contains processed rainfall data for the target area and period, extracted from analyzed rainfall data. 
For details on analyzed rainfall data, please refer to the  `Japan Meteorological Agency website <https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/kurashi/kaiseki.html#:~:text=%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90%E9%9B%A8%E9%87%8F%E3%81%A8%E9%80%9F%E5%A0%B1%E7%89%88,%E3%81%94%E3%81%A8%E3%81%AB%E4%BD%9C%E6%88%90%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82>`_

For this example, the file "rain.dat", which has already been converted to the RRI rainfall data format, is provided. 
By using `UC tools <https://tools.i-ric.info/login/>`_, which is available to anyone upon registration, you can also easily create rainfall data files ("rain.dat").

３．Calculation condition (Flow only)
--------------------------------------------------

3.1 Creating and Verifying the Grid and Grid Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go to "Grid > Select Grid Algorithm > RRI DEM and River Grid Creator" to launch it.

When performing sediment calculations, the channel width is an important parameter for evaluating bed shear stress, so set it to correspond to the actual conditions in the field.
Also, in this calculation, the parameters related to channel depth (`Cd`) are set to large values to prevent the river channel from being completely filled with sediment.

The "Grid Generation" dialog will open. Set the following conditions.

**"Terrain Data" tab**

.. figure:: img_2/rri_demAdjust2_main.jpg
   :scale: 50%
   :alt:

- Coordinate System: Lat/Lon
- DEM file: filldem.txt
- DIR file: dir_kurokawa.txt
- ACC file: acc.txt

**"River Shape" tab**

.. figure:: img_2/rri_demAdjust2_river.jpg
   :scale: 50%
   :alt:

- River Channel Cell ACC Threshold: 500
- River Width: :math:`C_w=12, S_w=0.5`
- River Depth: :math:`C_d=8, S_d=0.2`
- Levee: Height [m] = 0, Minimum ACC for height setting = 500

Click "Generate Grid(C)" to start processing.
When processing is complete, grids and grid attributes are automatically created.

Save the project and open it from "File > Open".

You can check the grid shape and the created cell attribute values in "Object Browser > Grid".

To display the map, set the coordinate system from "File > Propaty > Coordinate System" and select "WGS84" or a similar system. 

Check the "Cell Attributes" box to display each information type.

        :align: center

Channel Depth [m]: Channel depth is set using the function :math:`D = C_d A^{S_d}`, where A is the upstream accumulation area and the parameters are those specified.

Other set parameters, such as Levee Height (m), can also be confirmed here. If you map land use, rainfall distribution set in 3.2, rainfall (mm/h), and grain size distribution (area) set on slopes and river channels as cell attributes, you can also check them here.

-----

3.2 Setting Rainfall 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use the "rain.dat" data file shown in "2. Creating the Rainfall Dataset" for the rainfall conditions.

Open the calculation condition setting screen from "Calculation Condition > Setting", select "Group > Rain", and set the following:

.. list-table:: Rainfall
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_2/cond_2.jpg
     - | Rain file: Specify the "rain.dat" file
       | downloaded as sample data.
       
       | xllcorner_rain:130
       | yllcorner_rain:33.33
       | cellsize_rain_x:0.0125
       | cellsize_rain_y:0.0083333


This completes the rainfall data settings.

-----

3.3 Time Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the calculation condition setting screen, select "Group > Time Control" and set the following:  
This time, to shorten the calculation time, the analysis is performed only for the 13 hours around the peak rainfall time.

.. list-table:: Time Control
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_2/cond_3.jpg

       | Time Step for Slope Simulation [sec]: 600
       | Time Step for River Simulation [sec]: 60
       | Number for Output Times: 13

-----

3.4 River Simulation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, specify the threshold value for identifying river channel cells and the Manning's roughness coefficient for cells identified as river channel cells.

The smaller the threshold value for identifying river channel cells, the further upstream the river channel (where bed load and suspended load calculations are performed) will be considered, making this threshold value as a kind of parameter.

.. list-table:: River Simulation Parameters
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_2/cond_4.jpg
     - | Manning Roughness for River Region：0.03
       | threshold of flow accumulation：500

-----

3.5 Slope Simulation Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Slope simulation parameters are set in relation to the cell attribute "Land Use Type". In this example, since "Land Use Type" is not specified, "Land Use Type" for all cells will be "Region1". 
Here, the parameters are adjusted for the inflow to the Terauchi Dam, and are set as follows:

.. list-table:: Slope Simulation Parameters
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_2/cond_5.jpg
     - | Only parameters for Region1 are enabled.

       | Manning's Roughness for Slope: 0.4
       | Soil Layer Thickness (m): 0.7
       | Void Ratio: 0.471

       | ksv[m/s]: 0

       | ka[m/s]: 0.06
       | Unsat.porosity: 0.1
       | beta: 8

-----

4．Run Calculation (Flow only)
--------------------------------------------------
Before conducting sediment calculations, it is recommended to run a flow-only calculation first to verify that the calculation conditions are set correctly and to perform calibration. 
In this example, the parameters used have been calibrated for water runoff for the entire Terauchi Dam basin.

On the calculation condition screen, set the execution mode in "Base Conditions" to "Run only". Click "OK" to close the calculation condition setting screen.

.. image:: img_2/cond_0.jpg
        :width: 480px
        :align: center


Execute the calculation by clicking "Calculation > Run".

**Always save your data before running the calculation.** 

On a typical desktop computer, the calculation time is about 5-10 minutes. When the calculation is complete, a screen will appear indicating completion.


５．Visualizing Calculation Results (Before Sediment Calculation)
--------------------------------------------------
Once the calculation has finished successfully, the visualization window becomes available. 
Even before conducting sediment calculations, you can check the following items:

６．Calculation Condition for RSR model
--------------------------------------------------

6.1 Basic Settings for the Sediment Runoff (RSR) Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Open the calculation condition setting screen from "Calculation Condition > Setting".  Under "+ RSR Model", set the conditions related to sediment runoff.

.. list-table:: RSR Model
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Screen
     - Condition
   * - .. image:: img_2/cond_6.jpg
     - | Sediment computation (RSR): "Unit channel model"

       |  - Start time of bed deformation (hour): 2
       |  - Bed material type: Non-uniform
       |  - iidt (= dt_river/dt_sediment cal.): 1000
       |  - Bedload transport formula
       |  - Suspended sediment erosion formula

To shorten the calculation time, sediment analysis is not performed during the period after the start of the calculation when there is no rainfall (2 hours here). 
For the time step for riverbed variation calculation, set how many times sediment calculations are performed within one calculation time interval of the river channel in the RRI model. 
When dealing with suspended sediment, a smaller time step (larger value here) will improve calculation stability. However, a larger value will increase calculation time.


6.2 Detailed Settings for the RSR Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next, configure the detailed settings. For the most part, the default values for the detailed settings are used, however, the maximum erosion depth for each unit river channel, the minimum unit river channel slope, and maximum unit river channel slope are parameters that need to be set carefully. 
Here, the maximum erosion depth is set to 3m, and the minimum unit river channel slope is set to 0.00005.

.. list-table:: Detailed Settings for the RSR Model
   :widths: 70 30
   :header-rows: 1
